<p>This week in class we talked about code linting and code formatting using <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> and <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>.
These kinds of tools automate a lot of the otherwise labour-intensive and easy-to-miss nitpicks reviewers often leave on pull requests, freeing up time to review much more important elements such as design and code structure.
Many tech companies - <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/">Google</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.io/javascript/">AirBnB</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions">Microsoft</a> to name a few - have their own code style guides, much in the same way that writing organizations (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/en/collections/news-style-guide">news organizations</a> and <a href="https://www.apastyle.org/">scientific publishing</a>, for example) have documents that outline how to maintain consistency in publications across many hundreds of outlets and thousands of writers, and the idea of a style guide is not new.
However, the idea of automating this style checking to help developers maintain a consistent style has gained a lot more traction in recent years thanks in part to style and formatting tools coming standard and enabled by default in many modern programming languages.</p>

<h2 id="formatting-as-a-first-class-tool">Formatting as a First-Class Tool</h2>

<p>I was first exposed to this idea of a universal formatter as part of a language&rsquo;s toolchain when I started experimenting with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>.
Go&rsquo;s <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/"><code>gofmt</code></a> enforces a consistent style not just within one project, but across the <em>entire</em> ecosystem of Go code, making even foreign codebases more accessible because of their consistent style.
This consistency helps to reduce visual noise, making it easier to focus on what the code says rather than how it&rsquo;s formatted.
This idea of a universal formatter appears in other languages like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>&rsquo;s own <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt"><code>rustfmt</code></a>, though there are many other tools for enforcing style that predate these tools, such as <a href="https://www.rubocop.org/en/latest/">rubocop</a> for Ruby and <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/">astyle</a> for C and C++.</p>

<p>In Go and Rust, these formatters increase productivity dramatically because as long as you write syntactically correct code, it can be the ugliest code you have ever written and by passing it through the formatter (and many editors and IDEs will even format the source for you when you save!) you can leave it up to the formatter to make the code pretty and readable.
This means less time fiddling with alignment, worrying about indentation, and dithering over where to break your function call chain to best communicate your intent.
It also means that wars over format like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tabs-vs-spaces-from-silicon-valley-2016-5">tabs versus spaces</a> are dead; the formatter is the absolute arbitrator of the correct style, and because the formatter is consistent across the entire ecosystem there is a lot of pressure for users to conform instead of trying to tweak the formatter to their own personal preferences.</p>

<p>We still have an <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/21">open issue</a> on <code>supernova</code> for implementing <code>rustfmt</code> as part of our continuous integration process that we hope to close out with a pull request relatively soon so we can be sure all the code contributed to <code>supernova</code> follows the same format as other projects.</p>

<h2 id="build-infrastructure-weirdness">Build Infrastructure Weirdness</h2>

<p>Speaking of our continuous integration process, we ran into a very curious issue with <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/24"><code>0xazure/supernova#24</code></a> this week where our builds started failing on the <code>beta</code> release channel.
The build failure is caused by <code>clippy</code>&rsquo;s <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-clippy/current/index.html#new_ret_no_self"><code>new_ret_no_self</code> lint</a> which checks to ensure that, as a convention, <code>new</code> methods are used to make a new instance of a type and return that instance as the return value.
In the issue, the build is only failing on the <code>beta</code> release channel which was surprising because I was expecting this lint to have failed the build on the <code>stable</code> release channel as well if it failed on <code>beta</code>.
To further confuse the issue the build on <code>nightly</code>, which per our configuration for <code>supernova</code> is allowed to fail, was successful.</p>

<p>Digging into the problem some more, it looks like we are running into <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/issues/3313"><code>rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy#3313</code></a> where the <code>new_ret_no_self</code> lint is incorrectly triggering on a <code>new</code> function that <em>does</em> return <code>Self</code>, it&rsquo;s just wrapped by a container type or tuple.</p>

<p>Indeed, we can see this from our implementation of <code>Config::new</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn new(mut args: env::Args) -&gt; Result&lt;Config, &amp;'static str&gt; {
    args.next();

    let username = match args.next() {
        None =&gt; return Err(&quot;No username provided&quot;),
        Some(arg) =&gt; arg,
    };

    let token = args.next();

    Ok(Config { username, token })
}
</code></pre>

<p>which triggers the resulting lint failure</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">error: methods called `new` usually return `Self`
  --&gt; src/lib.rs:18:5
   |
18 | /     pub fn new(mut args: env::Args) -&gt; Result&lt;Config, &amp;'static str&gt; {
19 | |         args.next();
20 | |
21 | |         let username = match args.next() {
...  |
28 | |         Ok(Config { username, token })
29 | |     }
   | |_____^
   |
   = note: `-D clippy::new-ret-no-self` implied by `-D warnings`
   = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-clippy/v0.0.212/index.html#new_ret_no_self
</code></pre>

<p>even though our return type is <code>Result&lt;Config, &amp;'static str&gt;</code> which unwraps to <code>Config</code> on success and a <code>static str</code> when there is an error in creating a new instance.</p>

<h2 id="investigating-the-root-cause">Investigating the Root Cause</h2>

<p>An important part of build infrastructure is reproducibility: the ability to run a build with the same inputs and get the same outputs.
Without reproducibility we have flaky tests that no one wants to run and worse, no one trusts.
In the case of <code>supernova</code> we have a build matrix to test on all three release channels: <code>stable</code>, <code>beta</code>, and <code>nightly</code>, and we need to make sure testing on these channels happens in a predictable way.</p>

<p>It turns out the issue results from how <code>clippy</code> is installed in each environment.
The recommended way to install <code>clippy</code> is as a <code>rustup</code> component using <code>rustup component add clippy-preview</code>.
However, because <code>clippy</code> is published as a component for <code>rustup</code> rather than as some kind of version-pinned project dependency, this command does not install the same version of <code>clippy</code> across all release channels.
This can be verified as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo +stable clippy --version
clippy 0.0.212 (125907ad 2018-09-17)

$ cargo +beta clippy --version
clippy 0.0.212 (b1d03437 2018-10-19)

$ cargo +nightly clippy --version
clippy 0.0.212 (d8b42690 2018-11-04)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that while all of the build numbers are the same (<code>v0.0.212</code>), the commit hashes and dates are all different.</p>

<p>It is important to verify that the tool(s) you&rsquo;re using to test or lint your project are the same version in <strong>all</strong> of your environments, otherwise you&rsquo;ll end up with confusing build failures like the one we did here.
In our case we are testing against <code>beta</code> and <code>nightly</code> to have an idea of future changes to the Rust compiler and any new lints that may get added in the future, so failures on anything but <code>stable</code> are nice-to-have information rather than complete show-stoppers.
In other cases, or in different matrices, it&rsquo;s even more important that the test environment is as consistent as possible and that the number of variables that <em>are</em> being changed are as small as possible to make tracing failures relatively simple.</p>

<p>Lint tools are great for catching low-hanging fruit in code review, but you can&rsquo;t blindly trust them.
When there <em>is</em> a failure, it takes a person&rsquo;s knowledge of the project to determine if the failure is legitimate or if there&rsquo;s a problem in the tool or lint rule and to determine if it&rsquo;s a problem with the submitted code, a problem with the tool configuration, or a false positive in the tool as in this case with <code>clippy</code>&rsquo;s <code>new_ret_no_self</code> lint.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the Problem</h2>

<p>After <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/24#issuecomment-437530272">reaching out to some friends</a> in the <code>#rust</code> IRC channel, we decided to <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/27">not run <code>clippy</code> on the <code>beta</code> toolchain</a> to avoid more false positives like this in the future.
We are keeping <code>clippy</code> enabled for the <code>nightly</code> release channel because we are allowing <code>nightly</code> to fail on Travis so while we will investigate those failures it will not block landing any pull requests if for some reason <code>nightly</code> or <code>clippy</code> on <code>nightly</code> finds fault with our code.</p>

<p>I also recently filed <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/32"><code>0xazure/supernova#32</code></a> to provide better visibility into the versions of tools we install to match how Travis prints out tooling versions for tools that come automatically installed with the Rust build environment.
This should help us track down version discrepancies and make trouble-shooting failures much quicker.</p>

<p>After landing the above fix (and <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/30">an extra tweak</a> so we only run Travis against the <code>master</code> branch), our builds went fully green <a href="https://travis-ci.org/0xazure/supernova/builds/455179153">for the first time</a> since we enabled Travis on the project!
Setting up automated builds can take a lot of up-front effort, but it pays big dividends as the project grows to ensure the quality of the software being written.
Now we just <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/8">need some tests</a> so we can verify our code is actually correct&hellip;</p>

<p>In my day-to-day, I use <em>a lot</em> of command-line tools.
I generally find myself to be much more productive working in a non-GUI environment, mostly down to the fact that I can type much faster than I can move and aim a mouse and the less time I spend switching between keyboard and mouse the more time I can spend typing.
Unfortunately, command-line tools have one major drawback: discoverability.
If I am given a GUI application, I can click around, hover over different UI elements, and generally get a feel for how the interface is laid out.
In a command-line tool, I don&rsquo;t have any of these visual cues to help me learn the functionality; I have to start typing and see what happens.
To supplement this lack of visual cues, good command-line tools generally have autocomplete snippets for your shell so you can type the command name and start hitting <code>TAB</code> to see what options are available at a particular time, as well as extensive <code>man</code> pages that describe all the various options, commands, and any sub-commands (though these <code>man</code> pages are often extraordinarily verbose and rarely provide useful examples of how the tool is commonly used, so <a href="https://tldr.sh/">alternatives such as <code>tldr</code></a> fill this gap).</p>

<p>I want <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova"><code>supernova</code></a> to be a good command-line tool, so I have been thinking about ways to improve discoverability and make the tool easier to use.
A really interesting post by <a href="https://twitter.com/jdxcode">Jeff Dickey</a>, an engineer at Heroku, crossed my timeline recently titled <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a>
In his post, Jeff provides twelve principles to guide CLI design in a similar fashion to Heroku&rsquo;s original <a href="https://12factor.net/">Twelve-Factor App</a> methodology.
Out of the twelve principles, Principle 2 stood out to me, particularly in the context of <code>supernova</code>; Jeff suggests to &ldquo;prefer flags to args&rdquo; when designing a CLI.
He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes args are just fine though when the argument is obvious such as <code>$rm file_to_remove</code>. A good rule of thumb is 1 type of argument is fine, 2 types are very suspect, and 3 are never good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rule of thumb got me thinking about <code>supernova</code>&rsquo;s current calling convention.
Currently, you would use <code>supernova</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ supernova &lt;username&gt; [&lt;auth-token&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>This violates Jeff&rsquo;s rule of thumb because <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;auth-token&gt;</code> are not the same type of argument, and it&rsquo;s arguably even worse because the <code>&lt;auth-token&gt;</code> is optional here.</p>

<p>I opened <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/16"><code>0xazure/supernova#16</code></a> to track this problem with our current calling convention.
In it, I suggest using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap">clap</a> crate to improve our CLI and provide the facilities to do command-line argument parsing.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-clap">Introducing Clap</h2>

<p>Clap is a great crate that makes it super easy to add all kinds of CLI goodies to your command-line tool including auto-generated help, version, and usage information which are all, as Jeff highlights in Principle 1: Great help is essential, important to good CLIs.</p>

<p>Adding clap to the project would check off Principles 1 &amp; 2, so I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/19">created a pull request</a> to add clap and improve <code>supernova</code>&rsquo;s calling convention. All that was necessary was to create a new clap-based <code>App</code> with the desired arguments and flags, provide good help messages, and set <code>&lt;auth-token&gt;</code> to be an optional argument.
Having done all that, this is what clap generates, all for 13 lines of code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">$ supernova --help
supernova 0.1.0

USAGE:
    supernova [OPTIONS] &lt;USERNAME&gt;

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -t, --token &lt;TOKEN&gt;    Sets the authentication token for requests to GitHub

ARGS:
    &lt;USERNAME&gt;    The user whose stars to collect
</code></pre>

<p>Clap will print the name as well as the version with every <code>--help</code> request.
I was a little wary of this at first, because while I definitely want to include this information in my CLI, I also don&rsquo;t want the maintenance burden of having to remember to update the version string in <code>main.rs</code> every time a new version is published.
However, clap exposes some <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/#macros">very handy macros</a> that make use of environment variables <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates">exported by <code>cargo</code></a> at build time to pull this information out of <code>Cargo.toml</code>, so these values will always be up to date with the crate&rsquo;s metadata and don&rsquo;t require setting the values in code.</p>

<p>To actually extract all of the parsed arguments from clap, we call <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/struct.App.html#method.get_matches"><code>App::get_matches()</code></a> which produces an <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/struct.ArgMatches.html"><code>ArgMatches</code></a> struct we can query for specific arguments by name. Instead of parsing out each argument, I decided to try my hand at implementing the <code>From</code> trait to convert <code>ArgMatches</code> into <code>supernova</code>&rsquo;s <code>Config</code> type so it can be passed directly to the next function call.</p>

<h2 id="traits-in-rust">Traits in Rust</h2>

<p>Before I talk about implementing the <code>From</code> trait, I want to quickly talk about what traits actually are, as well as why I chose to implement <code>From</code> instead of one of the other conversion traits.</p>

<p>The Rust Book <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch10-02-traits.html#traits-defining-shared-behavior">explains traits like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A <em>trait</em> tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are familiar with the idea of <em>interfaces</em> in other languages such as Java or Go, traits are a very similar idea.</p>

<p>There is an important caveat with traits.
Again, from the Rust Book, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch10-02-traits.html#implementing-a-trait-on-a-type">Chapter 10.2, <em>Implementing a Trait on a Type</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One restriction to note with trait implementations is that we can implement a trait on a type only if either the trait or the type is local to our crate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that I will need to implement my conversion on a type that I control, <code>Config</code>, to convert between <code>ArgMatches</code> and <code>Config</code>.</p>

<p>The restriction on traits is very interesting, because while it is not necessary in my case it raises the question of how to convert from types that I do control into types defined in the standard library or in other crates.
If I wanted to convert a <code>Config</code> object into a <code>String</code> for example, it might make sense to use the conveniently named <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html"><code>Into</code> trait</a>.
However, the documentation for <code>Into</code> states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Library authors should not directly implement this trait, but should prefer implementing the <code>From</code> trait, which offers greater flexibility and provides an equivalent <code>Into</code> implementation for free, thanks to a blanket implementation in the standard library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, instead of implementing <code>Into</code>, I should implement the conversion of <code>Config</code> <strong>from</strong> <code>String</code>, and I get the equivalent <code>Into</code> implementation for free?
It seems a bit backwards since we are defining a trait that converts in the <em>opposite</em> direction of our needs, but because of this blanket implementation in the standard library we get symmetric conversions between types for free as long as we implement <code>From</code> on the type.
That means we only have to write the conversion function once instead of needing to write it once in each direction, and I&rsquo;m definitely in favour of anything that reduces the amount of code I need to write.</p>

<h2 id="the-from-trait">The <code>From</code> Trait</h2>

<p>Actually implementing the <code>From</code> trait was straight-forward, other than the <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/19/files#diff-b4aea3e418ccdb71239b96952d9cddb6R27">necessary addition of a lifetime annotation</a> because of how <code>ArgMatches</code> is implemented on clap&rsquo;s side.
Implementing <code>From</code> also let me replace another method in <code>Config</code> which reduces the surface area of <code>Config</code>&rsquo;s implementation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not totally happy with implementing <code>From</code> on <code>Config</code> because I had to pull clap into the library side of <code>supernova</code> instead of leaving arguments parsing completely in <code>main</code>, so I may go back and change this implementation to provide better separation between data and arguments parsing.
Or I may decide to move <code>Config</code> out to its own module which would also increase separation of concerns.
Either way, I was very happy to get my hands back on the keyboard writing Rust code this week, and I hope to be writing more in the near future!</p>

<p>After a <a href="/2018/11/hacktoberfest-a-month-of-open-source">month of open source</a> following my <a href="/2018/09/a-return-to-open-source">return to open source</a>, the next step in my journey is to really immerse myself in one or two projects and start making larger contributions. The open source course I&rsquo;m taking is encouraging us to complete contributions to three &ldquo;external&rdquo; open source projects over the next 5 weeks, as well as make three contributions to &ldquo;internal&rdquo; projects during the same period. In this case, &ldquo;external&rdquo; refers to established projects in the open source community and &ldquo;internal&rdquo; refers to projects we as a class are starting ourselves to get a feel for being core maintainers of a project so we can gain experience on both sides of the process. As a class we had a brainstorming session to come up with ideas for internal projects we could start, and I donated one of my existing side-projects to the list, which has lead to&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="level-up">Level Up!</h2>

<p>With absolutely zero fanfare, hoops to jump through, or documents to sign, I suddenly became the initial maintainer of one of our course&rsquo;s internal projects. I was able to generate enough interest in my side-project that members of my class wanted to contribute, and the project was added to the official list of internal projects. The amazing thing about open source development is you don&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s permission or to be told to create something; if you have an idea and enough people are interested in using and/or growing that idea, you have an open source project. The project itself grows in a very organic way as people find out about the project and drop in to see what&rsquo;s going on. Some people just drop in and perhaps contribute a little bit or share their use-case for the project, while others get started and then decide to stick around for a long time; that is the nature of open source.</p>

<h2 id="supernova">supernova</h2>

<p>The project I am maintaining is <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova"><code>0xazure/supernova</code></a>, and I would really encourage you to come check us out! We&rsquo;re still in the early stages, but we would encourage any and all to take a look at what we&rsquo;re building, make comments and submit issues or pull requests, and give us feedback. Even though it has been deemed an &ldquo;internal&rdquo; project for the course, we still welcome contributions from anyone who wants to get involved so stop by and <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/new">file an issue</a> if you have any questions.</p>

<p><code>supernova</code> started out as a learning project for me to improve my understanding of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> programming language, a {,de}serializing library written in Rust called <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>, and the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>. I am a project-oriented learner, so whenever I have some tools and techniques I&rsquo;d like to learn or improve, I start a project that tries to use them so I can have a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. The initial implementation as a CLI tool was designed to pull <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/starring/#list-repositories-being-starred">stars data</a> from the GitHub API and display it in a formatted list. I have a tendency to use stars like I would bookmarks so I have accumulated a lot of stars since I joined GitHub, but I have no great way to view all of my stars in one place (GitHub insists on paginating the list) or export them in various formats. <code>supernova</code> was only added to the internal projects list a week ago, but we already have <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues?utf8=✓&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+created%3A&lt;2018-11-04">a number of open issues</a> to start growing <code>supernova</code>&rsquo;s feature set.</p>

<h2 id="first-week">First Week</h2>

<p>In the first week we&rsquo;ve been focusing on a lot of the low-hanging fruit for a new open source project: setting up the project infrastructure and documenting what we already have.</p>

<p>There are currently a few open issues for writing docs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/4">0xazure/supernova#4</a> - Update the Readme</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/7">0xazure/supernova#7</a> - Create contributing guidelines</li>
</ul>

<p>as well as the ever-present need to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#making-useful-documentation-comments">document existing code</a>.</p>

<p>Within the first week we&rsquo;ve also <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/9">set up and enabled</a> TravisCI for testing and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy">linting</a> our codebase thanks to <a href="https://github.com/SeanPrashad">Sean Prashad</a> and made <code>supernova</code> more accessible to new contributors by <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/pull/15">converting existing documentation to Markdown</a> thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mordax">Mordax</a>. I really enjoyed landing these contributions; it&rsquo;s really exciting to see something I started as a side-project to get better at writing <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> grow and take on a life of its own.</p>

<h2 id="next-week">Next Week</h2>

<p>In the next week or so we hope to have a lot of the initial set up completed so that we can move on to adding functionality. My personal goal for next week is to submit a pull request for <a href="https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/16">improving the usability of <code>supernova</code></a> by following Guideline #2 of <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> to &ldquo;prefer flags to args&rdquo; to make input to the CLI more explicit and clear, as well as many other usability benefits.</p>

<p>I also need to start thinking about what external project(s) I want to contribute to over the next few weeks; I have some ideas from my contributions during Hackoberfest, but I&rsquo;ll need to make a decision soon so I can get set up to contribute.</p>

<p>The past month has flown by so quickly. After a full month dedicated to contributing to the open source community, I want to reflect on my experiences with Hacktoberfest 2018 and write a bit about things I learned over the past month, what went well, what I would do differently next time, and a general reflection on the Hacktoberfest event itself.</p>
<p>First, a reflection on my goals. For the month of Hacktoberfest I wanted to make contributions to a number of different projects, and I specifically wanted to <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-one">contribute to at least two projects that use Rust</a>. How did I do?</p>

<p>In the past month, I made 4 contributions (issues or pull requests) to 2 different projects that use Rust. Ironically, I did not have the opportunity to <em>use</em> Rust or write any code as part of those contributions as all of those contributions were in the form of documentation. However, I did still achieve the goal I had set for myself for Hacktoberfest!</p>
<p>I also ran some quick stats on my blog posts for this past month, as shown below:</p>
<pre class="code text literal-block">

</pre>
<p>For the month of October, I wrote a total of <tt class="docutils literal">4013</tt> words about my contributions to open source, writing a one-time maximum of <tt class="docutils literal">1579</tt> words during Week 3 about <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-three">documentation and different ways to contribute</a> to open source projects.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-went-well">
<h2>What Went Well</h2>
<p>Overall, I think Hacktoberfest was a positive experience. I had some really great interactions with the open source community on GitHub, and all of the project maintainers were very encouraging and helpful. Special shout-out to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sendilkumarn">Sendil Kumar N</a>, a member of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm">rust-wasm</a> team, for an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/pull/128#pullrequestreview-167612434">especially warm welcome</a> to the Rust and WebAssembly Book repository.</p>
<p>I am also happy to share that all of my pull requests were merged within the month. Hacktoberfest does not require pull requests to be merged as part of participating, only that they are created, but it was very validating that I did not have to go back to the drawing board or make many changes to my contributions for them to be accepted by the project maintainers. Hacktoberfest is definitely geared more towards small fixes and improvements, and while it is less likely to happen during an even like this I have made other contributions in the past that got tied up in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a> and nitpicking such that no progress was made for weeks or months at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-do-differently">
<h2>What to do Differently</h2>
<p>Now that Hacktoberfest is over, I definitely think it was a mistake to jump around from project to project. Every time I went to make a contribution to a new project I would have to ramp up again, learning how the project is organized, where I can find existing documentation, how to successfully contribute to the project, etc. I also didn't feel like I was immersing myself in a community the way I had hoped to while participating in Hacktoberfest this year. As I have written about before, I am <a class="reference external" href="/2018/09/a-return-to-open-source">not a stranger to open source</a>, so I definitely felt there was something missing this month, and I think the project-hopping contributed to this feeling.</p>
<p>The next time I participate in Hacktoberfest, I will be trying to focus a lot more on contributing code rather than documentation or other forms of contribution. I <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-three">wrote at length</a> about different forms open source contributions can take during week three of Hacktoberfest and while I do not want to deemphasize the importance of things like documentation I am a programmer at heart, I genuinely enjoy writing code, and I'd like to do more of that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reflecting-on-hacktoberfest">
<h2>Reflecting on Hacktoberfest</h2>
<p>Hacktoberfest is a great outreach event to get more people participating in open source. There is definitely more awareness in the community the past few years about the new contributor experience, and GitHub tags like &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22">help wanted</a>&quot; and &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?q=label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22">hacktoberfest</a>&quot; make it a lot easier for people to find projects and get involved. One of the downsides to this is sifting through all of the results to find a project of interest or an issue that details a fix or feature a new contributor might actually be able to tackle.</p>
<p>Which brings us to: time constraints. Hacktoberfest is a month-long event, which seems like an excessive amount of time on October 1st, but once the event moves into its last week everyone realizes how little time a month turns out to be. The Hacktoberfest <a class="reference external" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#stats--global">global stats</a> bear this out: there was a pretty healthy uptick in contributions during the last few days of the event as more contributors worked towards completing their five pull requests.</p>
<p>These time constraints can also make people feel like they need to contribute as much as possible as quickly as possible, leading to contributions that focus on quantity over quality. Or interactions like the one I had on one of the first projects I was going to contribute to for Hacktoberfest: I indicated my interest in attempting to fix an issue, and someone else - who did not participate in the discussion on the issue or check if an issue had already been claimed - submitted a pull request ahead of me. <em>Twice</em>. Thankfully I had not started on an implementation at that point, so I simply moved on to another project and a different contribution.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to this problem definitely falls to project maintainers. Creating separate issues for each contribution and assigning those issues to the claimant can resolve the ambiguity of who has priority to submit a pull request for a given issue. Also, not merging pull requests from anyone other than the claimant would go a long way to encouraging potential contributors to get involved and make sure they are taking unclaimed issues, rather than dropping off a pull request and moving on to the next contribution.</p>
<p>In the projects I <em>did</em> contribute to, I had a really pleasant experience. The Rust projects in particular are very welcoming; the Rust community is well known for being friendly and inclusive and it was a pleasure to contribute to making these projects even better.</p>
<p>All in all, I learned a lot this Hacktoberfest, particularly about myself, the kinds of projects I'm interested in, and how I personally like to contribute to open source. I'm looking forward to putting those lessons into practice during next year's Hacktoberfest, as well as in the rest of my open source contributions going forward.</p>

<p>With this fifth week, Hacktoberfest 2018 comes to a close. I'll be doing a retrospective on the whole month of contributions soon, but that is not this post. This week, I was able to make one of the contributions I had started back in <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-three">week three</a>, a documentation contribution to the <a class="reference external" href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/">Rust and WebAssembly Book</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in that post, I had filed <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/issues/127">rustwasm/book#127</a> to suggest some improvements to the explanation of <tt class="docutils literal">src/utils.rs</tt>, a module that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template">project template</a> provides to make working with Rust compiled to WebAssembly easier including some debugging helpers in the form of a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook">panic hook</a> to print well-formatted and helpful wasm error messages to <tt class="docutils literal">console.error</tt>. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fitzgen">Nick Fitzgerald</a>, a member of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html#Dev-tools-team">Rust dev tools team</a>, responded to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/issues/127#issuecomment-433858876">my issue</a> and said that he would be happy to merge a pull request that did the rephrasing I had suggested. Since I had already done the work up-front when I filed my issue, I was able to get a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/pull/129">pull request with the change</a> up very quickly and it got merged the same day.</p>
<p>My change is <a class="reference external" href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html#wasm-game-of-lifesrcutilsrs">live on the Rust and WebAssembly site</a> right now, and it feels really great to see something that I wrote included in a project in which I'm excited to get even more involved. Big thanks to Nick for getting back to me about my proposed change and for the quick merge on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/pull/129">rustwasm/book#129</a> to get it incorporated.</p>
<p>With that pull request opened (and merged), I was able to achieve my five pull requests for Hacktoberfest and secure my limited edition T-shirt. The T-shirt is nice, of course, but the real benefit of Hacktoberfest is to all the open source projects that took pull requests this past month, as well as for all the participants who were able to level up their programming skills while contributing to the open source community. More on that in the next post where I'll summarize my experience participating in Hacktoberfest 2018 and talk about what I learned, what went well, what I would do differently next time, and a general reflection on Hacktoberfest itself.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest week four! In keeping with the theme I <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-three">set last week</a> I continued to improve open source project documentation as part of Hacktoberfest. This week I returned to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo">dplesca/purehugo</a>, the theme I use for this blog, to help out with improving some areas of the documentation I noticed could use a bit of polish during my first contribution to the project during Hacktoberfest <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-two">week two</a>.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo/pull/28">dplesca/purehugo#28</a> I rephrased the section of the <tt class="docutils literal">README.md</tt> that deals with code syntax highlighting on generated blogs. As I mention in the issue, it seems as though the original author simply missed a word when writing the section:</p>
<blockquote>
All you need to do is to let rainbow.js the language of the highlighted code [...]</blockquote>
<p>which should instead read:</p>
<blockquote>
All you need to do is to let rainbow.js <strong>know</strong> the language of the highlighted code [...]</blockquote>
<p>The simple fix in this case would be to add the missing word. However, since I knew I would be editing this part of the document anyways, I decided to take a bit more time and rephrase the existing wording to simplify the instructions and use more specific language to instruct new users what they need to do to get the highlighting library to pick up the desired language. I also added a full example of how to apply <a class="reference external" href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> syntax to a code block using Markdown, as I find seeing complete code samples or full examples in documentation to be very helpful when I'm learning a new tool or framework, and serve as quick reminders if I'm returning to a tool or framework I haven't used recently to get me back on track.</p>
<p>This week turned into a twofer because while I was working on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo/pull/28">dplesca/purehugo#28</a> I noticed a small spelling error elsewhere in the <tt class="docutils literal">README.md</tt> file and submitted <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo/pull/27">dplesca/purehugo#27</a> to correct a word in one of the document headings. I only noticed the spelling mistake as I had just set up proper spell checking in Visual Studio Code using <a class="reference external" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright">Spell Right by Bartosz Antosik</a> to warn me about typos and other spelling errors. I had been under the impression that VS Code shipped with spell checking by default but this does not seem to be the case. Further, the VS Code spellchecking addon I found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-spell-check">published by Microsoft</a> is marked as deprecated and suggests finding an alternate addon. Correcting minor typos in documentation is small potatoes compared to some other Hacktoberfest contributions, but they are important changes that affect readability, comprehension, and the flow of the document(s) in which they occur.</p>
<p>The end of Hacktoberfest is almost upon us, and I have one last post to share about my final contribution this month. Look forward to a piece about my first major contribution to a Rust project!</p>

<p>As of last week we are just about half way through Hacktoberfest. Time is just flying by, and I can't believe how quickly it's passing. In my <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-two/">previous Hacktoberfest post</a> I wrote about my slightly self-interested contribution to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo">dplesca/purehugo</a>, the theme I use for this blog, and how I used some of Hugo's built-in functions to normalize URLs that used the <tt class="docutils literal">.Site.BaseURL</tt> variable.</p>
<p>My contribution this week for Hacktoberfest is minor, but it started me on a path to encounter a number of issues with a common theme that should leave me with plenty of work to do over the next few weeks and possibly past the end of the month.</p>
<div class="section" id="theme-week-documentation">
<h2>Theme Week: Documentation</h2>
<p>There has been a trend over the last number of years for contributors to open source to diversify how they contribute to open source. Code is not the only kind of contribution maintainers hope to receive, and they are happy to receive contributions in the form of documentation, code examples, sample projects, and feedback from first-time users, among others.</p>
<p>For Hacktoberfest week three, I focused my efforts on project documentation, or a lack thereof, specifically from the perspective of a new user. So far during Hacktoberfest I haven't made more than one contribution to the same project; instead I've jumped around quite a bit to different projects that use many different languages and project structures. This project hopping has given me some perspective on the onboarding and getting started instructions of a number of projects, which are critical for encouraging adoption and helping new users get up to speed on how to use or contribute to a project, application, or service. Documentation can also be tricky to get right the first, second, or even fifth time because it is hard to write a document that is useful for every audience, especially if the topic is technical in nature and the author(s) can't make many assumptions about the audience's technical background or ability. Many projects deal with this by dividing the documentation in two: one set of high-level documentation on getting the project up and running aimed at users, and another set of documentation that augments and extends this high-level documentation aimed at contributors and developers that provides much more technical detail.</p>
<p>This past week also reiterates the importance of contributing to projects in ways other than implementing new features, writing test cases, or fixing bugs in code. There are so many ways to contribute to open source projects, and one of the best ways new contributors can help a project is to verify the project's onboarding flow by following basic steps like the project setup information and getting their development environment up and running. These are tasks that established contributors and maintainers do not have to do very often and documentation can get out of date; new contributors are great at spotting problem areas in guides, tutorials, and example code that can improve the onboarding experience and identify areas where further explanation may be necessary that established contributors may not be able to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-one-rust-wasm">
<h2>Project One: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt></h2>
<p>I have been excited about <a class="reference external" href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> since I first heard about the work being done to support it in multiple browser engines. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format predominantly designed for the web (though its success on the web will surely spur adoption in other areas just as NodeJS forced us to rethink possible applications for JavaScript) that can be targeted by many other languages like C++, Rust, Go, and Java, among others. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt> is the Rust initiative to provide compilation for the wasm target as well as support interoperation with existing JavaScript code both shipped in browsers and provided as libraries through tools like <tt class="docutils literal">npm</tt>.</p>
<p>I wanted to get up and running with WebAssembly as a compilation target for Rust, so I decided to read some of the core documentation provided by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt> team: the <a class="reference external" href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/">Rust and WebAssembly Book</a>. After taking a brief detour to set up a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/0xazure/homebrew-tap/blob/master/Formula/wasm-pack.rb">personal Homebrew tap</a> for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wasm-pack</span></tt> tool (which I hope, once the prerequisite Rust version lands on the stable channel, I will be able to contribute back to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">homebrew/hombrew-core</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt>), I was able to set up all of the necessary project dependencies to start working through <a class="reference external" href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/introduction.html">the tutorial</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="hello-world">
<h3>Hello, World!</h3>
<p>The Rust and WebAssembly Book bases the tutorial off a project template to get new users up and running more quickly. It spends a portion of <a class="reference external" href="https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html">the introductory section</a> talking about each file in the template and its purpose in the larger project. When I got to the section describing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wasm-game-of-life/src/utils.rs</span></tt>, I was given this explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">src/utils.rs</tt> module provides a couple included batteries that we will use later in the tutorial. We can ignore it for now.</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Rust and WebAssembly, <em>5.2 - Hello, World!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the reasonably detailed explanations of other files in the project, this section stood out to me as one that could be improved. This section also makes reference to a philosophy of &quot;batteries included&quot;, which I had only ever been exposed to before <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included">in Python jargon</a> and that may not be familiar to everyone who has not had a similar exposure, or for whom English is not their primary language and the idiom is lost in translation.</p>
<p>Being a fresh set of eyes on the Rust and WebAssembly Book, I filed <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/issues/127">rustwasm/book#127</a> to discuss some suggestions for how this section could be improved without the need for jargon-heavy idioms and to provide more details about the particular module in question. At the time of publishing I have not heard back from anyone on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt> team, but I am hopeful that I will be able to submit a pull request before the end of the month to improve this part of the tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="typos-and-transcription-errors">
<h3>Typos and Transcription Errors</h3>
<p>Reading through the rest of the page, I ran across the simple error of a duplicated word in the explanation of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wasm-game-of-life/www/index.js</span></tt>. I submitted my correction as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/pull/128">rustwasm/book#128</a> and it was accepted the same day. I even received a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustwasm/book/pull/128#pullrequestreview-167612434">congratulatory message</a> from one of the maintainers on my first contribution to the project which, as my first interaction with any of the project maintainers, is a nice personal touch that definitely makes me wanto to continue to contribute to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-two-diesel">
<h2>Project Two: Diesel</h2>
<p>I have been playing around with reimplementing a currently active Postgresql-backed project using Rust, and discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://diesel.rs/">Diesel</a> as one of the ORM tools at the forefront of Rust development stacks. As with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt>, I have not used Diesel in any of my projects, so I turned to the <a class="reference external" href="http://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started/">getting started guide</a> Diesel provides. It wasn't long after I got the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">diesel-cli</span></tt> tool installed that I ran into a discrepancy between the guide and the behaviour of the CLI tool, so I filed <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1891">diesel-rs/diesel#1891</a> to detail my expectations along with the actual output the tool was producing, as well as some suggestions for improving the clarity of documentation in a few disparate but related areas of the codebase and guide.</p>
<p>I am of course very grateful for the guide because it is much more approachable - with many code samples and examples - than reading highly technical API documentation or <tt class="docutils literal">man</tt> pages. However, it can be intimidating for a new user if they are following along with the steps in the guide and something unexpected happens; often the new user doesn't know if they did something in the wrong order or missed an important step, or if the guide is simply out of date and they are not sure how to get around the outdated part to continue their progress. It is also common for code and documentation to get out of sync, resulting in confused and annoyed users. Unfortunately there isn't a great technical solution to this issue and authors need to always take care to not only update code but also documentation, though Rust's <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/documentation-tests.html">documentation tests</a> are one example of a tool that can help by ensuring that example code included in comments is up to date and working.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-next">
<h2>Project: Next</h2>
<p>As I am still a new user of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rust-wasm</span></tt> and <a class="reference external" href="http://diesel.rs/">Diesel</a>, I am sure there are still many things I can contribute to these projects, both in terms of improving the onboarding experience for new users as well as other non-code contributions. I also have my eye on a few areas of the guide for <a class="reference external" href="https://rocket.rs/guide">Rocket</a>, a web framework written in Rust that was the reason I started using Diesel. I'm hoping to hear back soon about the two issues I filed to improve documentation, and I'd like to take the time this month to shepherd them through to getting pull requests opened and merged. As for this week, I'll be picking out my next few contributions for Hacktoberfest and might also start thinking about picking a project to stick with for a while now that I've worked on a number of projects so far this term.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest week two! <a class="reference external" href="/2018/10/hacktoberfest-week-one/">Week one</a> was all about getting into the groove of Hacktoberfest, making a small change to contribute, and finding out about other awesome projects in open source and <a class="reference external" href="/categories/rust/">my area of interest</a>.</p>
<p>My contribution for this week had a bit more self-interest involved; I contributed a change to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo">dplesca/purehugo</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> blog theme I use for this blog, to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo/pull/26">normalize URLs</a> that use Hugo's <tt class="docutils literal">.Site.BaseURL</tt> variable.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo">dplesca/purehugo</a> theme, I was noticing that many links to other parts of the site - that is, links that were not external links to e.g. GitHub or Twitter - contained multiple slashes after the site root. Modern web browsers are really good at dealing with partially-malformed URLs so there was no functional problem with any of the links as the browser's URL parser took over and cleaned them up into a value it could resolve, but it would still be better if the URLs were correctly formatted when Hugo generates the static site content.</p>
<p>The malformed URLs looked something like this:</p>
<pre class="code html literal-block">
<span class="punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="name tag">a</span> <span class="name attribute">class</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;pure-button&quot;</span> <span class="name attribute">href</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;http://localhost:1313//index.xml&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>[...]<span class="punctuation">&lt;/</span><span class="name tag">a</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>
<span class="punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="name tag">a</span> <span class="name attribute">class</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;post-category post-category-open source&quot;</span> <span class="name attribute">href</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;http://localhost:1313//categories/open-source&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>open source<span class="punctuation">&lt;/</span><span class="name tag">a</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Delving into the template code revealed how <tt class="docutils literal">dplesca/purehugo</tt> was generating the URLs:</p>
<pre class="code html literal-block">
<span class="punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="name tag">a</span> <span class="name attribute">class</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;pure-button&quot;</span> <span class="name attribute">href</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/index.xml&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>[...]<span class="punctuation">&lt;/</span><span class="name tag">a</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>
<span class="punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="name tag">a</span> <span class="name attribute">class</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;post-category post-category-{{ . }}&quot;</span> <span class="name attribute">href</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;{{ $baseUrl }}/categories/{{ . | urlize }}&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>{{ . }}<span class="punctuation">&lt;/</span><span class="name tag">a</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>The template string used <tt class="docutils literal">.Site.BaseURL</tt> and appended a slash before the next URL fragment. Since this results in a double slash in the generated output, I presume but have not confirmed that <tt class="docutils literal">.Site.BaseURL</tt> always ends in a trailing slash that needs to be taken into consideration when generating URLs relative the the site's root.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-solution">
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>In a similar way to how we join file paths in NodeJS with <a class="reference external" href="https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_join_paths">path.join()</a>, we almost never want to be responsible for building URL paths ourselves. Luckily, Hugo provides <a class="reference external" href="https://gohugo.io/functions/">many built-in helper functions</a> that cover a whole range of use cases, including the one I decided to use to normalize URL paths throughout <tt class="docutils literal">dplesca/purehugo</tt>: <a class="reference external" href="https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/.">absURL</a></p>
<p>From the Hugo documentation, <tt class="docutils literal">absURL</tt></p>
<blockquote>
Creates an absolute URL based on the configured <tt class="docutils literal">baseURL</tt>.</blockquote>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal">baseURL</tt> is the hostname (and path) to the root of the site which is set as part of Hugo's <a class="reference external" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#all-configuration-settings">site configuration</a>.</p>
<p>This function was a perfect solution in most of the places where static files need to be linked and served to the client, such as JavaScript or CSS content. In those cases it was a simple matter of removing <tt class="docutils literal">.Site.BaseURL</tt> and the subsequent concatenation and replace it with a call to the <tt class="docutils literal">absURL</tt> function, like so:</p>
<pre class="code html literal-block">
<span class="punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="name tag">a</span> <span class="name attribute">class</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;pure-button&quot;</span> <span class="name attribute">href</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">'{{ &quot;index.xml&quot; | absURL }}'</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>[...]<span class="punctuation">&lt;/</span><span class="name tag">a</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Normalizing the post category links turned out to be a bit more complicated than this simple substitution because these links needed to include more URL fragments to create the complete path. In order to correctly concatenate and then normalize these URLs, I turned to another of Hugo's built-in functions: <a class="reference external" href="https://gohugo.io/functions/printf/">printf</a>.</p>
<p>Hugo's templating system is built almost entirely on top of Go's built-in <a class="reference external" href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">template package</a>, which makes things very familiar if you have worked with Go templates before. It also means that Hugo can expose a lot of Go functions as Hugo functions available inside templates. In this case, Hugo's <tt class="docutils literal">printf</tt> function exposes Go's <tt class="docutils literal">fmt.Sprintf</tt> function which works much like <tt class="docutils literal">printf</tt> in C.</p>
<p>This is the solution I came up with for building the more complicated post category link URLs while still being able to normalize the resulting URL using <tt class="docutils literal">absURL</tt>:</p>
<pre class="code html literal-block">
<span class="punctuation">&lt;</span><span class="name tag">a</span> <span class="name attribute">class</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">&quot;post-category post-category-{{ . }}&quot;</span> <span class="name attribute">href</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="literal string">'{{ ( printf &quot;categories/%s&quot; . ) | absURL }}'</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>{{ . }}<span class="punctuation">&lt;/</span><span class="name tag">a</span><span class="punctuation">&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Unlike in NodeJS, in this case it's safe to do a simple string concatenation of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">categories/&lt;category-name&gt;</span></tt> because unlike with file systems, the fragment separator in URLs is always the <tt class="docutils literal">/</tt> character.</p>

<h2>To be Continued</h2>
<p>I am very thankful to <tt class="docutils literal">purehugo</tt>'s author, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dplesca">&#64;dplesca</a>, for responding so quickly to my pull request with this change and for merging the pull request within a few hours of my submission. While working on this change I noticed a few other areas where I think <tt class="docutils literal">dplesca/purehugo</tt> could be improved, and I'm looking forward to working on it more as I continue using it to generate my blog and host my site content.</p>
<p>Hacktoberfest continues on, and I need to start thinking about my next contribution. My school is on a break starting next week, so I'm hoping to find the time to dig into something a bit larger and more challenging based on the projects I've seen so far or had recommended to me by classmates.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest, start! In my <a class="reference external" href="2018/09/a-return-to-open-source/">previous post</a> I mentioned that I was hoping to find some interesting projects to contribute to this month, and so far I've come up with a pretty good shortlist of contributions I want to make.</p>
<p>To start the month off, I lent a hand to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lk-geimfari/awesomo">lk-geimfari/awesomo</a> to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lk-geimfari/awesomo/pull/125">reorganize their list</a> of Rust projects. They had already reorganized the one for Python and suggested contributors use that as a model for the rest of the reorganizations. There are still a bunch of languages on the list in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lk-geimfari/awesomo/issues/101">tracking issue</a>, so head on over and give them a hand!</p>
<p>The work itself was straight forward; contributors were asked to alphabetize the projects in the list, and provide a table of contents and headings based on the example. I think this was a great first issue for Hacktoberfest because my goal for this month is to contribute to at least two projects that use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a>, and what better way to find out about cool projects than working with a list chock full of them?</p>
<div class="section" id="alacritty">
<h2>Alacritty</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty</a> was one of the first projects to catch my eye, not just because it was originally at the top of the list, but also because I saw an announcement post that Alacritty <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9gl75a/alacritty_now_supports_scrollback/">now supports terminal scrollback</a> which introduced me to the existence of the project in the first place. Alacritty claims to be &quot;the fastest terminal emulator in existence&quot;, and uses the GPU for rendering to enable optimizations that aren't possible using other terminal emulators. Alacritty is still very much in its infancy, with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/releases/tag/v0.2.1">version 0.2.1</a> as the most recent release at the time of writing. Windows support is planned before a 1.0 release, so if this intrigues you and you're a Windows developer <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/28">have a look at the tracking issue</a> and see if you can help out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diesel">
<h2>Diesel</h2>
<p>Another project I was aware of before working with this awesome list of Rust projects is <a class="reference external" href="http://diesel.rs/">Diesel</a>, a safe, extensible object-relational mapper (ORM) for Rust. When deciding on the technology stack for my capstone project this year, I investigated using the <a class="reference external" href="https://rocket.rs/overview/">Rocket</a> web framework written in Rust, and Diesel is one of the ORMs <a class="reference external" href="https://rocket.rs/guide/state/#dependencies">recommended in the getting started guide</a>. Diesel provides a comfortable CLI experience for developers familiar with tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html">ActiveRecord</a> from Ruby on Rails and <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.sequelizejs.com/">Sequelize</a> in NodeJS, but drastically improves on both by leveraging Rust's type safety and by &quot;eliminat[ing] the possibility of incorrect database interactions at compile time.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exa">
<h2>exa</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://the.exa.website/">exa</a> is a modern replacement for the built-in unix <tt class="docutils literal">ls</tt> command which aims to have better defaults and more features. I have been using <tt class="docutils literal">exa</tt> myself for a few weeks and I am really enjoying the experience so far. With <tt class="docutils literal">ls</tt> I set up a number of shell aliases and functions to do things like enable human-readable sizes and always show colours; in <tt class="docutils literal">exa</tt> these features are turned on automatically without any setup. I am all for customizability in those cases where it's absolutely necessary but sane defaults is almost always a better solution, especially with a tool that most of us use hundreds of times a day.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="to-be-continued">
<h2>To be Continued</h2>
<p>I definitely have some ideas about more projects that I'd like to contribute to after seeing the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lk-geimfari/awesomo">lk-geimfari/awesomo</a> list, either this month for Hacktoberfest or on an ongoing basis. If Rust isn't your language of choice, there are similar lists of projects in pretty much every popular language as well as some more obscure ones, so take a look, be inspired, and happy hacking!</p>

<p>Today marks the first month of my return to open source. I say <em>return</em> even though I never really <em>left</em>, it's more of a return to active participation in the community. As I <a class="reference external" href="/2018/09/third-times-the-charm/">wrote about earlier</a>, one of my courses right now focuses on open source development, so I have been able to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/0xazure?tab=overview&amp;from=2018-09-01&amp;to=2018-09-30">contribute much more regularly</a> and I hope to be able to continue to do so even after the course is over.</p>
<p>This past month has been all about getting back into the swing of things by contributing to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer">filerjs/filer</a>, a port of NodeJS' <tt class="docutils literal">fs</tt> module to the web using backends like IndexedDB. My first contribution to filer, which I have <a class="reference external" href="/2018/09/its-dependencies-all-the-way-down/">already blogged about</a>, was to update a development dependency to resolve package vulnerabilities as reported by <tt class="docutils literal">npm audit</tt>. This issue was logged as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/issues/384">filer#384</a> and fixed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/pull/385">filer#385</a> by updating the vulnerable dependency. This issue also spawned some discussion as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/issues/386">filer#386</a> about automating the process of keeping project dependencies up to date so it is much easier to stay on top of new versions of dependencies.</p>
<p>Open source isn't just about contributing code and documentation though. It's also about the community, interacting with other developers, discussing issues and potential solutions, as well as reviewing and helping out other members of the community. In addition to helping out my classmates over Slack and in-class throughout the month, I also reviewed a few pull requests opened against the filer repository.</p>
<p>The first issue I reviewed, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/pull/478">filer#478</a>, is a pull request that adds a test to <tt class="docutils literal">fs.watch()</tt> to verify the event type emitted when renaming an existing file. Other than the boilerplate mocha test code, the test logic itself is fairly straight forward. However, <tt class="docutils literal">fs.watch()</tt> and related watching functions are an interesting set of methods because they are not guaranted to be consistent due to the <a class="reference external" href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_caveats">underlying implementation details</a>. I actually had to go back to this pull request and re-review it because it turns out that filer <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/issues/411#issuecomment-422946490">doesn't currently have support</a> for <tt class="docutils literal">rename</tt> events at all. This issue was also interesting because I picked out a minor style nitpick in the form of a missing semi-colon that the Travis build <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/issues/482">didn't seem to pick up</a> for some reason. Rerunning the build resolved the issue, but it's always worrying when you run into issues with your build infrastructure and tests because it can shake your faith in them a bit.</p>
<p>Another issue that I reviewed was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/pull/472">filer#472</a>. This pull request adds a test to ensure that reading from a nonexistant file results in an error. The submission is well done overall, with one minor nitpick that lead to me filing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/filerjs/filer/pull/498">filer#498</a> to reduce small nitpick-type comments on reviews. Nitpicks are generally a waste of everyone's time because style should be automatically enforced by some kind of automated tool before code is pushed; JavaScript doesn't have anything quite like <a class="reference external" href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt">rustfmt</a>, but tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/xojs/xo">xo</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">prettier</a> can help. In this review I also cautioned the original author of the pull request about changing multiple variables at a time in a test, which we ideally would like to avoid as we can easily end up testing more code paths than we either need or want to, thereby complicating the test or making it fragile against future changes to the code.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, October marks the beginning of <a class="reference external" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. I'm really excited to be participating this year; I participated once before but I either missed the cutoff or something happened to my package because I never received my t-shirt from DigitalOcean. I'll be writing a lot more short blog posts throughout October as I chronicle my participation in this event, and I'm hoping to find some interesting projects to contribute to for at least the rest of this year and hopefully well into the next.</p>
