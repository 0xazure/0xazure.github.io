      <description>I&#39;ve been meaning to start blogging for a while. Not even blogging consistently, just writing some long-form-ish pieces on projects that I&#39;ve been working on, things I&#39;ve learned, or things that I might want for my own reference. I&#39;ve tried at least twice before - once when I purchased this domain back in December of 2013 and again at the end of 2016 - and as evidenced by the utter lack of content it&#39;s pretty clear I haven&#39;t been successful.</description>
